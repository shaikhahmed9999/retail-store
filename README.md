**Problem Statement**

- On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you
get $ 45 as a discount).
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.

- Write a program in a Java â€“ Spring boot with test cases such that given a bill, it finds
the net payable amount. Please note the stress is on object oriented approach and test
coverage. User interface is not required. What we care about:

**Required Activities**
- Object oriented programming approach, provide a high level UML class diagram of all the key classes in your solution. This can either be on paper
or using a CASE tool
- Unit tests to achieve good code coverage, good use of Mocking
- Code to be generic and simple
- Leverage today&#39;s best coding practices
- Clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the coverage reports can be generated
